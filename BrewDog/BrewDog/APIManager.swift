//completion handler needs to be @escaping because you're dealing with data, which be used to do stuff asynchronously (not in time with the function, so the closure might complete its processes AFTER the function returns; which is why "self." is needed in all closures passed in); by default, closures are @nonescaping, meaning your closure will complete before the function returns
    //basically @escaping if closure completes after function returns
        //OR if closure will be stored in a variable that was defined outside of the function
    //@nonescaping if closure completes before function returns
